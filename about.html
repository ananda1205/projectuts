        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Computer Technician with two years of hands-on experience in hardware and software troubleshooting, system maintenance, and technical support. A graduate of Computer Science from Gadjah Mada University, I am skilled at working under pressure and resolving complex technical issues efficiently. During my time at the University of Indonesia, I successfully reduced system downtime by 30% through preventive maintenance and responsive technical assistance. I am proficient in Windows and Linux operating systems, network troubleshooting, and hardware repair. With strong communication, critical thinking, and teamwork abilities, I am eager to contribute to a dynamic and collaborative work environment.
